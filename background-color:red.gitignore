    <p>My name is Eleazar Contreras Jr. and first year student. I was born in Mexico and moved in Chicago in 2001. I currently live in Chicago, IL for about thirteen years. I have hearing family, but I have two brothers and a few cousins, who are deaf. I attended to Bell School (elementary school) and Illinois School for Deaf (high school). My hobbies are playing a video game, biking , watching Naruto and One piece series, and collecting state quarters. Fun fact about me is a first member in my family to attend in college and refuse to eat every sea food except tuna with mayo and flavor of lime. If you wish to know more about me, contact me through my email. My email is <a href=mailto:ec8155@g.rit.edu>ec8155@g.rit.edu</a> </p>
